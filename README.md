Context: They provide context, showing how the concept is applied in practical situations. This aids in comprehension and retention.

2. Visual Aids:
Simplification: Visuals like diagrams, charts, and infographics can break down complex information into simpler, digestible parts. A flowchart can illustrate the steps of a process more clearly than text alone.

Engagement: Visuals capture attention and keep the audience engaged. They make the information more appealing and easier to remember.

3. Analogies and Metaphors:
Familiarity: Analogies and metaphors use familiar ideas to explain unfamiliar ones. Describing a network as a city's road system helps people understand how data travels between devices.

Simplification: They simplify complex concepts by comparing them to everyday experiences, making them easier to understand.
## 8. What types of visuals (e.g., diagrams, charts) are most effective for different kinds of technical information?
